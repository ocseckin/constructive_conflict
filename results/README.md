### Important note for reproducibility:

In accordance with Redditâ€™s policies, we do not release the original submission or comment texts (referred to as `clean_body` in the notebooks). To reproduce our results, researchers should rehydrate the dataset by retrieving the full texts from Reddit using the provided submission and comment IDs.

Note that some columns in `submissions.parquet` are generated by these notebooks and then saved back to the same file. Re-running the notebooks will therefore reproduce the same columns:
- Linguistic features such as `pos_tag_counts`, `hedge_ratio`, and `is_question` are created in `linguistic_features.ipynb`.
- The `bertopic` column is created in `topic_analysis.ipynb`.
